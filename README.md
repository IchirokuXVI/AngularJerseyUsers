# AngularJerseyUsers
This is a simple web application made with Angular and Jersey

It has user login with access and refresh tokens, profile editing (username, password) and a few options to customize the webpage design that are saved on the user.

If you want to run it on your server there is a .sql file in the backend folder. This webpage was developed using Jersey 2.32 in Tomcat 9.0.41 and Angular 10.1.6 in XAMPP 3.2.4.

Known errors:
  -User options will be all false if the page is refreshed before the request hasn't ended (only visual so refreshing again should be enough)
  
It would really help me to know about any error you get so let me know if you want !
